# INGENIA_TEST
Exercise1 Ingenia Firmware Embedded Engineer Test
Here there is the required code for the Firmware Embedded Engineer Test proposed by INGENIA.

Exercise1:
Assumptions: In the Exercise1 I assume that the API provided is implemented but in order to have something minimally compilable and usable I
did some dummy implementations which can be seen in the External folder. I also wanted to try testing by registering an interrupt handler on my PC,
but due to Hardware limitations and permissions limitations I could not test that implementation, that is why I added the preprocessor directive to 
show that if we had them we might be able to try them.

To compile the code we have to run the commands  inside the Exercise1 folder.: cmake .; make; and the executable Exercise1 will appear in the bin directory.

Exercise2:
The exercise2 has just the file Exercise2.c that contains the function that computes the maximum profit possible from a list of stock prices.
The solution meets the complexity requirements.
